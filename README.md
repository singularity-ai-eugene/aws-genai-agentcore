# AWS Bedrock AgentCore

## What is AgentCore?

AWS Bedrock AgentCore is a serverless platform for deploying and running AI agents at scale using any framework (Strands, LangGraph, CrewAI) and any model. It handles infrastructure, security, and scaling so you can focus on building agent logic.[^5]

**AgentCore Memory** - Short-term and long-term memory across sessions[^2]

**AgentCore Gateway** - Transform APIs into agent-ready tools[^9]

**Browser Tool** - Let agents interact with websites[^4]

**Observability** - Monitor agent performance with CloudWatch integration[^6]
